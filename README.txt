I wrote all of my code on a jupyter notebook using Anaconda version 4.3.1 for windows. All the
libraries necessary to run my code are included by default in the Anaconda packages.
The libraries that I imported are the following:
numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
datetime
mean_absolute_error from sklearn.metrics
train_test_split from sklearn.cross_validation
time
stats from scipy
GradientBoostingRegressor from sklearn.ensemble
GradientBoostingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble
OneVsRestClassifier from sklearn.multiclass
DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree 
AdaBoostClassifier from sklearn.ensemble 
SGDClassifier from sklearn.linear_model
CalibratedClassifierCV from sklearn.calibration
